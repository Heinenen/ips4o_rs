# ips4o_rs

This repository contains the code of our reimplementation of IPS4o, a unstable, in-place sorting algorithm.
The original implementation can be found at https://github.com/ips4o/ips4o, together with the accompanying paper.

The `crum_analyze` branch contains the result of our thesis, which makes the algorithm adaptive to nearly sorted inputs.

Our code was compiled with the `nightly-2023-01-30` toolchain.
